* Design
** Board representation
** Position representation
** move representation

* Compromises
** Exit forts
While the engine does detect exit forts, it only detects the 2 most minimal exit fort shapes, as detecting more complex shapes would be prohibitevely expensive. 

* Why not Rust
- My goal is to make the fastest engine possible, so I'll take the extra fraction of performance C provides over all of Rust's niceties
- I want easy access to exotic cpu intrinsics
- It's a fun excuse to become more familiar with a language that is so foundational to modern computing. For any more serious high-performance application I'd choose Rust.
